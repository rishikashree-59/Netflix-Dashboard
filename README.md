## 📊 5. Features / Highlights

### 🔹 Business Problem

Streaming platforms like Netflix host massive content libraries, but raw datasets do not easily answer critical business questions such as:

- Which genres dominate the platform?
- What content performs best in terms of quality and engagement?
- How does Netflix target different age groups?
- How have content trends evolved over time?

Without an interactive analytics solution, these insights are difficult to extract efficiently.

- Enables trend analysis of Netflix content growth  
- Compares genre performance and content quality  
- Evaluates viewer engagement using IMDb ratings and votes
